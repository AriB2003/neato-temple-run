        Attributes list:

            map_frame: the name of the map coordinate frame (should be "map" in most cases)
            odom_frame: the name of the odometry coordinate frame (should be "odom" in most cases)
            scan_topic: the name of the scan topic to listen to (should be "scan" in most cases)
            n_particles: the number of particles in the filter
            d_thresh: the amount of linear movement before triggering a filter update
            a_thresh: the amount of angular movement before triggering a filter update
            pose_listener: a subscriber that listens for new approximate pose estimates (i.e. generated through the rviz GUI)
            particle_pub: a publisher for the particle cloud
            last_scan_timestamp: this is used to keep track of the clock when using bags
            scan_to_process: the scan that our run_loop should process next
            occupancy_field: this helper class allows you to query the map for distance to closest obstacle
            transform_helper: this helps with various transform operations (abstracting away the tf2 module)
            particle_cloud: a list of particles representing a probability distribution over robot poses
            current_odom_xy_theta: the pose of the robot in the odometry frame when the last filter update was performed.
                                   The pose is expressed as a list [x,y,theta] (where theta is the yaw)
